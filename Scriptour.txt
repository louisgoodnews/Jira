Scriptunser which runeth in our Jira instances,
your plugin be installeth and the scriptrunner extension cometh.

Your script runeth, as in the console, so in the postfunction.

Forgivth us our logic and syntax errors, as we forgiveth the Jira API.

Lead us not into the temptation of def, but lead us to import the right class.

Because thine is the implementation of the solution in Groovy,

return.
