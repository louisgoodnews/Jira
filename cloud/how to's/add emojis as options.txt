1. To add emojis as options for a customfield in Jira, simply write a comment in a given issue containing all Jira emojis (i.e., those available in the comment menu).
2. Create an automation rule that will log the comment in particular.
3. Next, open the customfield administration in a new tab. There you can head to your customfield and create a new option.
4. For the value of the option, simply copy and paste the emoji from the automation log. Done!
